- Question: What information do you have about system setup?

## Search Results
```text
Document 1:
deployment, you’ll know exactly how to estimate the GPU memory needed to serve your LLMs
effectively.

Document 2:
Initial document

Document 3:
Focus on tracking: GPU memory usage, inference times, and request volumes
4. Model Management
MLflow for basic experiment tracking and model versioning
Keep track of which model versions are deployed and their performance
5. LangChain Integration
Use basic LangChain components for prompt management and chain orchestration
Start with simple chains and expand as needed
M is the GPU memory in Gigabytes.
P is the number of parameters in the model.
4B represents the 4 bytes used per parameter.
Q is the number of bits for loading the model (e.g., 16-bit or 32-bit).
1.2 accounts for a 20% overhead.

## System Response
```text
I'm afraid the documents provided don't contain specific information about system setup. They primarily focus on GPU memory estimation, tracking of GPU memory usage, inference times, and request volumes, model management, and LangChain integration. If you need assistance with system setup, could you please provide more specific details about what you're looking for?
